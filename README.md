## Helping Care for Homeless Communities

### Project Overview
*CareMS is inspired by my personal experiences of homelessness in both Skid Row, Los Angeles and more recently, Louisville, KY. Throughout my time in various shelters and programs, I've noticed the need for more modern, robust and specific software technologies in order to facilitate better care for clients through making workflows and processes more focused and effecient. My hope for CareMS is to help organizations achieve their overall goal to bettter care for their homeless communities through a client-first approach to software techonologies*.
