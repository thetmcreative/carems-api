## Helping Care for Homeless Communities

### Project Overview
*CareMS is inspired by my personal experiences of homeless in both Skid Row, Los Angeles and more recently, Louisville, KY. Throughout my time in various shelters and programs, I noticed the need for more modern, robust and specific software technologies in order to better care for clients as well as make workflows and processes more effecient. My hope for CareMS is to help organizations achieve their overall goals to bettter care for their homeless communities through a client-first approach through software techonologies*.
